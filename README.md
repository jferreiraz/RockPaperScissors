# Rock Paper Scissors



In this project, artificial intelligence was used so that the possible results of the rock, paper, scissors game could be predicted, thus making it a system capable of having a high victory rate. For this, you can play manually by training the machine, based on your moves the AI will seek to play against the rock, paper, scissors object that you played most often.

It was one of the development activities proposed to complete the machine learning course proposed by freeCodeCamp.
